# Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks
This code has been adapted from [HazyResearch/hgcn](https://github.com/HazyResearch/hgcn/tree/master).

## To-Do :
 - [ ] test backprop with radam
 - [ ] DeepCut
 - [ ] main.py
 - [ ] check hgcn issues.
 - [x] Graph layer.
 - [x] Init Code.

## Study about :
 - [ ] Distance matrix normalization.
 - [ ] Similarity as a dot product still valid?
